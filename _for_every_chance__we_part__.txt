# For every chance , we part


The clock ticked over and over against, a rythmic tone echo through her head. The room swayed back and forth, teh ceiling liquifiying before her eyes. She let out a gasp, her lungs caved and her mind went blank. Her feelings numbed, vision turned to black. Her ears started to thunder with the laughter of children. Suddenly it all stopped. Silence. Only a black abyss lay before her. A cold sharp pain hit her chest forcing her to her knees. Blood soaked her hands that held at her chest. It dripped down onto her skirt and pooled around her on the floor. She jumped up screaming, trying not to remember her past. 

"Laura, its time for school" her mothers voice brought her back.
