Its looks like that I will neeed to get better at typing so im nto so annoying when i mess up. So dumb haha . What is today ? Feb 10th Thursday. 

## Thursday Feb 10th


League which once dominate my life and streaming seem to be fleeting. Not that I do not enjoy those things, but at the same time, writing and creativity have been things that have given my life a lot of spice in my younger days. From the loveing memories of Amy and Jon to the not so light places that they went. I remember alot of them , alot of the journeys that I never wrote down. When I read what i wrote a long time ago I can picture exactly what I saw back then , its like going abck in time , so amazing. 

I broke alot of promises to my self. I told my self to write all the time and kept telling my self that I am a writer, but I never built the habit, I never just went for it. I stayed back , got swept away with everything else in my life nad eventually my characters got left behind to an extent. I stopped having conversations with jsut them , it always had to be a movie. When stephan kings talks about just observing the characters, I think i have been doing tha for so long, I just never recorded what I experienced. What I said , what I did. That was a sort of mistkae on my own part. To not trust in my self. To not go all the way with what i think I could be doing weith my life. Ignoring such a big part of me. It was foolish and not the best idea. I let other rthings that I thought would lead me down a path that might better for me write the stoies for me. Not that I regret what i have donw. Cause I do not. What I have done so far has been great. Learned alot, but its time. Its time to start the journey. Its time to write and tell the stories that I ahve always wanted to write. Its time to fulfill those promises to the past me , and to the future me. Its time to be a writer, not because i think that i am good at it or that i might be good at it, because deep with in. Thats what I am. I have just ignored it for so long. No longer will i ignore that feeling , those stories , those dreams that scream to be told. The characters whose lives pass me by , they flesh them selves infront of me , beg and plead to write about them .I shy away, saying what an interesting dream, cool concept. Write it down you fool. they are so vivid in my mind. So complete. They are there still waiting for me to explore. I will go one day through their doors. I might not return , but its okay. I am a story teller. A writer of the worlds that expose themselves to me. I do not just imagine. I wait and listen , watch and record what is gong on.
