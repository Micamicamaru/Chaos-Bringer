Alabaster Hearts

	Fire traced around the city, spreading like a wild serpent though the sea. Smoke covered the once star filled sky as the shrieks and cries lifted from the houses. The cedar houses stood no chance against the dry air and fire.  Every house lit up in seconds and burned bright and fast in a violent jumbled of flames. The city folk scrambled to save what was left of their lives or each other. So much chaos in stewed down below. A man and a young boy lounged back on a grassy knoll observing the town below. The boy curled up in a ball, his eyes peering down trying to look away but unable to pry his interested eyes away. The man perched his head on his right arm, looking as if he were bored. “Shouldn’t we help them father?” the boy unfolded his legs and peered over.  The man slapped him hard across the face. The boys body almost went tumbling down the hill from the force.
“Why would we go help them? Do you forget they we are the ones that started the fire?” The man lifted his right hand, red lines weaved up and down his forearm. Glowing like lava, breathing like they were alive.
