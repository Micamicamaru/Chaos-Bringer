Alina. A very proud young lady with extreme wealth and power.

Alina- A beautiful extremely wealthy young women from somewhere with very extreme tastes.  Her mother is an extremely powerful individual that owns a country and is heir to rule half of the countries around them. They live almost in a fantasy world where rules often slide to the side. People know what they are about and expect to see certain aspects of their lives broadcasted. The rich and powerful gather with them and they make decisions (or try too) 

How does this even involve me? well interesting enough I have fallen into the arms of alina. Bought to be exact. Traded for an extremely high amount of money in a human auction I end up as Alina's.


Writing this at work is kind of ... well it is kinda not good I should suppose. The idea is still fresh in my head, and I would like to follow it. It gives me a chance to imagine this sort of senario that will never happen and it would/maybe go much differently. I havent fully developed anyone in the story and it is just a thought from last night and into today.  I am suprised that I even thought about it today. Alina is very confident, but very human. She is sadistic and sweet at the same time. She thinks that she is control (while most of the time is) but some times finds her self suprised at her new pet. Feelings and emotions that she didnt want or even think to occur have happened. While she has had many before him (me) they have all been off. When her eyes set upon me for the first time, she gets weak in the knees and is overcome with emotion. she states that he is perfect and with a very passionate kiss, is convinced that he is the one she has been searching for.



I have let them down , so i can no longer look into their eyes. The sadness overcomes me and pulls me down into a state that I can no longer take. the screen flashes but I do not realize what is going on yet. The email has taken its time to get to me even though in this modern time, things should be instant. In a distant country a long period of time away a club exists. Give consent and they take your freedom and you become someone elses obsession. Their object to play with. What ever they want you do, what ever they desire you preform. No more let downs. Only servatude.

#Chapter 1


It took her a moment to look at him. To focus on his features and really take in what she was looking at. The boy was strapped in a adult stroller, bibbed, diapered and wearing a lavender onsie. His eyes were closed, probably dreaming of some far away place, or the life he had left behind. Her knees became weak and she braced herself on the marble column. He was perfect.The blond hair, soft face, tall and looked exactly what she always sought after. She approached huffing her and grinning widely.
