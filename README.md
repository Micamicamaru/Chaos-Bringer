A collection of Stories to sync to all my computers


This is mostly private collection (even if it is open to the public) This allows me to have the most up to date files of all my stories

with them being worked on and stored in writemonkey. My text platform of choice. I was goign to use write! but i would have to pay money for things
that i do not need. So here we go. Github will sync all my stories and be up to date no matter what.
